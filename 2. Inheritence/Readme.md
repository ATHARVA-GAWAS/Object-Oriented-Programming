# Inheritance :  

&nbsp;



1. Generalization VS specialization
    - Generalization refers to the process of creating a more general class from an existing class, inheriting its attributes and behaviors. It allows for code reuse and promotes modularity.
    - Specialization, on the other hand, refers to the process of creating a more specific class from an existing class, adding new attributes and behaviors. It allows for creating specialized versions of a class to meet specific requirements.
