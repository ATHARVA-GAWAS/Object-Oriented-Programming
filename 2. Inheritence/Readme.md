# __Inheritance__ : _The Code Legacy Continues..._

 __Like inheriting your parent's code, but without the family drama!__

### _Why Inheritance_ ?

- Reusability
- Extensibility
- Polymorphism
- Class Hierarchy
- Maintainability

&nbsp;

## 1. Generalization VS specialization

### __A . Generalization__

- Generalization refers to the process of `creating a more general class from an existing class`, inheriting its attributes and behaviors.
- In Generalization `group of classes are referred with Super class with single name.`
- __In Generalization A Super Class Is made by Grouping Multiple Sub
Classes__.
- It allows for __code reuse__ and __promotes modularity__.

- Generalization means __Bottom Up__.

- Generalization is achieved using __Interfaces__.

- For achieving Generalization __Abstract Classes are Used__.

### __B . Specialization__

- Specialization, on the other hand, refers to the process of creating `a more specific class from an existing class`, __adding new attributes and behaviors__.

- In Specialization __a new Sub Class is Generated by borrowing the
features of existing concrete class and adding new features to it.__

- It allows for creating specialized versions of a class to meet specific requirements.

- Specialization means __Top Down__.  

- Specialization is achieved using __Inheritance__.

- __Example__ :
