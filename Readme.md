## Introduction

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around objects and classes. It emphasizes concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to OOP concepts using various programming languages and real-world examples.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```  
git clone https://github.com/HarshalMPatil20/Object-Oriented-Programming  
```

2. Choose a programming language and navigate to the corresponding directory (e.g., `java-examples`, `python-examples`).

3. Explore the examples, exercises, and resources provided in each directory.

4. Refer to the README files in each directory for specific instructions and guidelines.
